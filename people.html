											<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1Ry3fI8AAAAJ&hl=en" title="Google Scholar" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Google Scholar</a>
											<p>Travis DeVault is the Associate Director for Research and Senior Research Scientist at the
												<a href="https://srel.uga.edu" title="SREL" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL)</a>
												. He also has a courtesy faculty appointment in the
												<a href="https://www.warnell.uga.edu/" title="Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Warnell School of Forestry & Natural Resources</a>
												where he advises graduate students. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in ecology and systematics from the
												<a href="https://www.indstate.edu/cas/biology" title="Department of Biology at Indiana State University" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Department of Biology at Indiana State University</a>

												<a href="https://ag.purdue.edu/fnr/Pages/default.aspx" title="Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Department of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University</a>. Travis is a wildlife ecologist and conservation biologist; his research focuses on understanding and preventing animal-vehicle collisions and other human-wildlife conflicts. He also maintains a long term research interest in the ecology of vultures and other vertebrate scavengers. Outside of work, Travis is a jack of all trades and master of none. He’s an eclectic sort who enjoys fishing, hunting, kayaking and canoeing, hiking with his family, wrestling with his dogs, playing basketball, obsessing over Chicago Cubs baseball and Indianapolis Colts football, blues guitar, tinkering in his woodshop, and playing video games while consuming bourbon and scotch. Actually, he is pretty good at that last one.

											<h5>Mary Chapman</h5>
											<p style="color: grey">Project Coordinator / mary dot chapman at uga dot edu</p>
											<p>Mary leads a study looking at heavy metals in birds that utilize a constructed wetland that receives industrial wastewater. She received her B.S. and M.S. in Environmental Science at Taylor University, Indiana. Her masters research looked at species richness of neotropical migrant birds at different forest corridor widths along an Indiana river adjacent to farmland. The goal was to determine how wide farmers would need to keep their corridors to provide habitat for a diverse array of bird species. Mary is interested in avian ecology and enjoys birding and hiking in her free time. She is working on passing her love of birds and nature on to her 5-year-old son.</p>

													<p>Carson received his B.S. in Biology from Central Michigan University where he studied black footed ferret genetics and the impacts of hiking trails on small mammal populations. He is currently an M.S. student at Warnell's School of Forestry and Natural Resources. Carson is studying the behavior of deer and wild pigs to help reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions. He is interested in behavioral ecology, wildlife conservation, and human-wildlife interactions.</p>
